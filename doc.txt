Anyone can take a picture, but not everyone can 
capture the right mood or moment. I am most at home
 behind a camera, and I feel connected to the world
  through my lens.

I fell in love with photography when I 
realized I could tell stories through images. 
I shoot because of an insatiable need to share
 these narratives with the world - and editorial 
 photography allows me to do that, every single day.
